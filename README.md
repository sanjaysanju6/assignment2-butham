### Code 

> The convex hull trick is a technique (perhaps best classified as a data structure) used to determine efficiently, after preprocessing, which member of a set of linear functions in one variable attains an extremal value for a given value of the independent variable.

[To know about convex hull](https://wcipeg.com/wiki/Convex_hull_trick)

```
typedef int ftype;
typedef complex<ftype> point;
#define x real
#define y imag

ftype dot(point a, point b) {
    return (conj(a) * b).x();
}

ftype cross(point a, point b) {
    return (conj(a) * b).y();
}

```
